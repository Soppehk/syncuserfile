Three weeks ago I spent a weekend in Lubiana with my family.
On the last day I woke up at eight o'clock, I had breakfast, I filled my suitcase and we started the return trip at 9 o'clock.
In mid-trip we stopped to visit the Postumia's caves.
At midday we ate a sandwich.
In the afternoon we visited the Giant Cave near Trieste.
We arrived home at seventeen o'clock.
I really enjoyed that day.
