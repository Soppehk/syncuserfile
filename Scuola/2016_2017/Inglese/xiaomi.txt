Xiaomi was founded in April 2010 by ex-Kingsoft CEO Lei Jun, as a software company creating a new custom ROM based on Google’s Android.
Their aim was to provide additional functionality that Android had yet to offer and an easy to use user interface. MIUI, the ROM which the team created, became a huge success and has been ported to many devices.
The MIUI ROM was likened to Apple’s iOS for being very easy to use whilst providing sophisticated services such as cloud backup, an easy to use music player and their own app store. The team at Xiaomi have alwasy wanted users to feel part of the company and happily take on fan feedback via multiple channels and update the ROM every Friday with bug fixes, optimisation and additional features.
In 2011 Xiaomi announced the Mi One phone. Xiaomi was now not only making its own software, but its own hardware too. The Mi One was a top spec phone with a great price way ahead of its time, this has remained Xiaomi’s philosophy from day one.
Demand continues to increase due to the high specification hardware of their devices and the price they sell their products at.
Xiaomi have launched other devices such as a smart TV, Wi-Fi router, a fan, a laptop ect.
Unfortunately Xiaomi doesn't sell own devices in Europe but we can bought a Xiaomi's smartphone via alternative store.
